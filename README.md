# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. In addition, we added a "dark" Mapbox style as a tile layer object.
